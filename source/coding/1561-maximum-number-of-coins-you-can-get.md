## Problem

There are `3n` piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

- In each step, you will choose **any** `3` piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
- Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
- You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
- Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
- Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.

Given an array of integers `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of coins in the `iᵗʰ` pile.

Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.

**Example 1:**

> Input: `piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]`
> Output: `9`
> Explanation: Choose the triplet `(2, 7, 8)`, Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
> Choose the triplet `(1, 2, 4)`, Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
> The maximum number of coins which you can have are: `7 + 2 = 9`.
> On the other hand if we choose this arrangement `(1, 2, 8)`, `(2, 4, 7)` you only get `2 + 4 = 6` coins which is not optimal.

**Example 2:**

> Input: `piles = [2,4,5]`
> Output: `4`

**Example 3:**

> Input: `piles = [9,8,7,6,5,1,2,3,4]`
> Output: `18`

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= piles.length <= 10⁵`
- `piles.length % 3 == 0`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10⁴`

## Test Cases

``` python
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, piles: List[int]) -> int:
```

## Thoughts

每次都取最大的两堆和最小的一堆，可以得到的硬币总数最多。

先对 piles 逆序排序，从第二大开始隔一个取一个，取 `piles / 3` 次即为可以得到的硬币总数。

时间复杂度 `O(n log n)`，做 in-place 排序额外的空间复杂度 `O(1)`。
